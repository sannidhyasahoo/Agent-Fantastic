## 🚨 The Problem We Solve

### Current Cybersecurity Challenges

**1. Reactive Security Approach**
- Most organizations only detect threats after damage is done
- Average breach detection time: 287 days
- Cost of data breaches: $4.45 million average

**2. Manual Threat Analysis**
- Security teams overwhelmed with alerts (99% false positives)
- Expert analysts are expensive and scarce
- Human analysis takes hours or days

**3. Network Blind Spots**
- VPC Flow Logs generate millions of records daily
- Traditional tools can't process this volume in real-time
- Critical threats hide in the noise

**4. Cost vs Security Trade-off**
- Enterprise security solutions cost $50,000-$500,000 annually
- Small-medium businesses can't afford comprehensive protection
- Cloud-native solutions are complex and expensive

### The Business Impact
- **$10.5 trillion** - Global cost of cybercrime by 2025
- **53%** of organizations experienced a cyber attack in 2023
- **Average downtime**: 23 days per security incident
- **Compliance fines**: Up to 4% of annual revenue (GDPR)
